Dear Sir/Madam,

    I am currently working with an organization that is developing
its own RDBMS with its own Kernel and the Finite State Automata,
implemented purely in "C".

    I am currently involved in implementing the 'Extended Procedural Language'
support to the database server, being implemented in C. I have worked
as a team member of 'ODBC Driver' and the Parser teams for breif
periods, these too are being implemented in C.

    Implemented the Windows-NT service for the database server, single
handedly, in C.

    In short, I have lived life C-style for the last 18 months, and
craving for more. And I consider myself to be quite a wiz with this
raw language. And I know quite a bit of assembly language too ( just
enough to understand what my C code is being converted into...) .

    I have also seen the LCC(the C compiler)'s code and am in posession
of 'Micro Controller (real-time)Operating System'(uC-OS)'s code.

    I want to delve further into the Embedded Systems field, and I
consider myself to be equipped to dive into this vast and varied field.

    So it is with great enthusiasm that I am attaching my resume for your
kind consideration.

Gurjeet Singh.
