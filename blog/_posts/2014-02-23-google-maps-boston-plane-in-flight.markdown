I'm not sure if I'm the first one to spot this, but I just found a plane captured in-flight by [Google Maps][GoogleMapsLink]

[GoogleMapsLink]: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Callahan+Tunnel,+Boston,+MA&hl=en&ll=42.339415,-71.016687&spn=0.003489,0.00662&sll=42.752811,-71.49671&sspn=0.221846,0.42366&z=18
