## TL;DR

I have adopted [Pastafarianism][] as my religion, and the [Flying Spaghetti
Monster][] as my Diety.

## How I Discovered Pastafarianism

A [Hacker News post][] about the Register article on [no-logging VPNs leaking
logs][] lead me to the [Algo][] project, which cryptically mentions [FSM][Flying
Spaghetti Monster].  Upon reading the Wikipedia article on Pastafarianism, I
immediately started liking the religion. It has all the hallmarks of a religion
I had been looking for. I plan to now do everything a devout Pastafarian is
supposed to do; follow all the dogmas and perform all the rituals.

I have now converted to Pastafarianism. Feel free to get in touch with me if you
think I can be of any help in converting you.
