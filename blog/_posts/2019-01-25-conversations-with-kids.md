(Referring to the STEM filed trip the day before)

Her: After "Dry Ice" I said "Liquid Nitrogen" because that was the other fancy word that came to my mind.

Me: When you call Nitrogen a fancy word, you don't sound intelligent.

Her: But *it is* a fancy word!

Me: (after a little thought) Do you think Toothbrush is a fancy word?

Her: No!

Me: That's because you use it every day, you know what it looks like, what you can do with it...

Her: Oh, so Nitrogen is not a fancy word for scientists because they use it every day?

Me: Maybe not every day, but they know it very intimately.
