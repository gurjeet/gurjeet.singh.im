If a website offers you to sign-in using Google (or any third-party service, say
Facebook, Github, etc.), don't use that feature.

The long and short of it is that if Google (or third-party of your choice) locks
your account for some reason, you will be locked out of _all_ the services where
you signed into using Google. There's no shortage of examples where people have
been locked out of Google (and other services), with no recourse to re-enable
their accounts, and consequently losing all data hosted or protected by that
Google account.

Every respectable service allows you to create accounts using your email
address, so please use that method to create your accounts.
