I really like the methods and philosophy of the [Waking Up][website] app by Sam
Harris. I think it's a great resource for those who want to try meditation,
without any connotations of religion attached to it. This is my attempt at
spreading the word.

The app has a unique pricing model that I haven't seen anyone else offer. They
offer the app for free to anyone who asks. Here's the poicy in Sam's own words
(captured from their [video][video]). I couldn't find this written anywhere on
their website, so I typed it up and published it here.

> So I want to take a moment to explain our business philosophy.

> Our intent is for everyone who wants access to all the content on the app to

>
> So while we’re running a business, we believe that money should never be the
> reason why someone can’t gain access to Waking Up. We also don’t want you to
> feel you're risking anything by subscribing.
>
> So here's our pricing policy: if you can't afford a subscription, just request a
> free account.
>
> You can do this directly at wakingup.com. There's a “request a free account”
> link or, you can contact support within the app, or you can send an email to
> support@wakingup.com. And if you do one of these things, will provide you with
> a free year on the app.
>
> And if you're uncertain about whether this policy applies to you, here’s how I
> think about it. If subscribing to Waking Up will prevent you from spending money
> on something else, in other words, if you have to do the math to see how the
> cost of a membership can fit into your life, please don't do that. This free
> policy is for you.
>
> I don't want anyone’s subscription to Waking Up to be a source of financial
> stress. And I consider myself immensely lucky to be running a digital business
> where we can have a policy like this. And this policy is not for the COVID-19
> pandemic. It’s been our policy since the day we launched. So the only judge of
> whether you can afford a subscription is you.
>
> We don't ask any questions, and we grant 100 per cent of these requests. And if
> your luck hasn't changed at the end of your first year, just ask for another one.
>
> For everyone else a subscription to Waking Up is truly risk-free. If you don't
> find the app valuable, just contact support, and will give you a full refund,
> again, no questions asked.
>
> So whatever your financial situation, there's no reason not to fully explore
> Waking Up to see how it impacts your life.
>
> So I encourage you to just start with the Introductory Course, and feel free to
> go at your own pace. And needless to say, you can always go back and repeat
> sessions as many times as you want. And please realize there's a world of
> difference between practicing, even only occasionally, and not practicing at
> all.
>
> Once again, welcome to Waking Up, and I want to thank you in advance for the
> effort you put in here. I think you'll find that it's worth it.
