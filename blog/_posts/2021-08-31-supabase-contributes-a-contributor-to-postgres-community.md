Yesterday I joined [Supabase][]; they provide Backend-as-a-Service, which is
developed on top of their Postgres-as-a-Service offering. They provide many
features, utilities, libraries, and services around the Postgres database that
makes it very easy to develop applications.

I'm very happy to say that they have very generously allowed me to focus
explicitly on contributing to the Postgres community. This is truly a dream
come true!

If you happen to be a Firebase customer, but miss the powers of the SQL
language, do check out [Supabase][].

Here's the announcement I posted to the Postgres Hackers mailing list, with some
more details and a statement from the founders of Supabase.
